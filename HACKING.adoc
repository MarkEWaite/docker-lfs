= Hacking documentation

This document explains how to develop on this repository.

== Requirements

* A Bourne-Again-Shell compatible prompt (bash)
* GNU `make` 3.80+
* Docker with https://github.com/docker/buildx[BuildX] capability
** Docker 20.10+ is recommended as it is usually packaged with Buildx
** Docker 19.03+ is required
** BuildX v0.5.1+ is needed (manual installation of the plugin can be done if you don't have it: https://github.com/docker/buildx)
* https://git-scm.com/[git] 1.6+ (git 2+ is recommended)
* https://stedolan.github.io/jq/[jq] 1.6+
* https://curl.se/[curl] 7+

We recommend https://www.gnu.org/software/parallel/[GNU Parallel] for parallel test execution, but it is not required.

// In case the link breaks, and the bug hasn't been fixed yet:
// On Apple Silicon in native arm64 containers, older versions of libssl in
// debian:buster, ubuntu:20.04 and centos:8 will segfault when connected to some TLS
// servers, for example curl https://dl.yarnpkg.com. The bug is fixed in newer versions
// of libssl in debian:bookworm, ubuntu:21.04 and fedora:35.

Tests currently do not work on Mac M1 due to a link:https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/release-notes/#known-issues[known issue] in 'Docker Desktop 3.4.0'.

== Building

=== Linux

[source,bash]
--
## build all linux platforms
make build

## only build a specific linux image
make build-debian_jdk17 # or build-alpine_jdk17 build-debian_slim_jdk17 build-debian_jdk17 ...

--

== Testing

=== Linux

Tests for Linux images are written using https://github.com/bats-core/bats-core[bats] under the `tests/` directory.

Tests pre-requisites are automatically managed by the `make prepare-test` target (dependency of any `make test*` target)  which:

- Ensures that the `bats` command is installed in the `bats/bin/` directory (along with all the bats project in `./bats/`)
- Ensures that the additional bats helper are installed as git sub-modules in `./tests/test_helper/`

For efficiency, the tests are executed in parallel.

[IMPORTANT]
Due to the parallel execution, each test should be self-contained
and not depend on another test, even inside a given test harness.

Please note that:

- You can disable the parallel execution by setting the environment variable `DISABLE_PARALLEL_TESTS` to the value `true`
- Parallel execution is disabled if the commands `docker` or (GNU) `parallel` are not installed.


You can restrict the execution to only a subset of test harness files. By setting the environment variable `TEST_SUITES`
to the path of the bats test harness file to execute alone.

[source,bash]
--
## Run tests for all linux platforms
make test

## Run tests for a specific linux platform
make test-debian_jdk17 # or test-alpine_jdk17 test-debian_slim_jdk17 test-debian_jdk17 ...

## Run tests for Alpine Linux JDK17 platform in sequential mode
DISABLE_PARALLEL_TESTS=true make test-alpine_jdk17

## Only run the test suite `functions.bats` for the CentOS 7 JDK11 platform
TEST_SUITES=./tests/functions.bats make test-centos7_jdk11
--

== Multiarch support

The buildx tool is used to build our multiarch images, this relies on either QEMU for emulating the architecture being built, or a remote builder configured for the required platform(s).

Planned supported architectures:

* amd64
* arm64
* s390x

== Debugging

In order to debug the controller, use the `-e DEBUG=true -p 5005:5005` when starting the container.
Jenkins will be suspended on the startup in such case,
and then it will be possible to attach a debugger from IDE to it.

== Test the publishing using an overridden target repository on Docker Hub

Create a new dedicated target repository in your Docker Hub account, and use it like follows:

[source,bash]
--
export DOCKERHUB_ORGANISATION=batmat
export DOCKERHUB_REPO=test-jenkins
# The log below will help confirm this override was taken in account:
./publish.sh
Docker repository in Use:
* JENKINS_REPO: batmat/test-jenkins
...
